# A Xonotic server docker container with map provisioning via http.

Build the container with (from within the docker subdirectory)
`docker build -t xonotic-server ./docker`

Run the container with
`docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 -p 26000:26000/udp --entrypoint /bin/bash -v $PWD:/opt/Xonotic/shared xonotic-server`

A work in progress, you need to share a folder containing you `server.cfg` file and a `maps` subdirectory with the maps you want to provide.
